	<h2>About</h2>
	<h3>I'm a graduating senior at Northeastern University and an aspiring web developer. In the fall, I plan to attend a web development bootcamp to build upon my skills and portfolio.</h3>
	<p>While earning a major in International Affairs and minors in Mathematics and Biology, I've struggled to find the field in which I feel most at home. However, I've finally found my place in web design and development.</p>
	<p>I absolutely love the idea of creating beautiful, functional, responsive websites, and I hope to continue exploring UX and design as well as programming.</p>
	<p>Over the past few months, I've dived into coding and tried to learn everything I can. I've completed <a href="http://dash.generalassemb.ly" title="Dash" target="_blank">Dash</a>, taken a Girl Develop It Javascript course, and am currently partway through <a href="https://hackdesign.org/lessons" title="Hack Design" target="_blank">Hack Design</a>, Udacity's Intro to Object Oriented Programming, and a variety of other courses and guides.</p>
	<p>I'm focusing my efforts on learning coding over the summer, and by the time I graduate from college in August, I'll be ready to take the next step with an intensive coding class.</p>
	<p>As the first step in creating a portfolio and stepping into a new field, I've created this website. The code can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/Hayley848/HayleyAnderson/tree/gh-pages" title="Github Repository of Hayley Anderson's Website" target="_blank">here</a>. I plan to add more to my portfolio by the time I complete a coding course so I'll be fully ready to switch fields and gain a full-time position as a junior web developer.</p>
	<p>If you would like to see my resume or if you have questions, please <a href="mailto:hayleyanderson@zoho.com" title="Email Hayley Anderson">email me</a>.</p><br>
